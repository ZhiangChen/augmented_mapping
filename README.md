# UAV System for Mapping Precariously Balanced Rocks (PBRs)


## Package Overview


This project aims to develop a UAV system capable of approaching, detecting, identifying, and mapping Precariously Balanced Rocks (PBRs) using advanced exploration algorithms. The mapping process is divided into three main stages:


1. **Approach Stage**: The UAV plans and follows a path to the PBR using the Fast Planner algorithm.
2. **Detection and Identification Stage**: The UAV detects rocks using YOLOv8 and identifies the target PBR with a recognition algorithm.
3. **Mapping Stage**: The UAV maps the identified PBR using the FUEL exploration algorithm and RTAB-Map.

## Parameter Details

### Map and Bounding Box

- **Map Size**: Adjust `map_size_x`, `map_size_y`, and `map_size_z` to match your simulation environment's dimensions.
- **Bounding Box**: Set `box_min_x`, `box_min_y`, `box_min_z`, `box_max_x`, `box_max_y`, and `box_max_z` to define the operational area within the map. Ensure these values are smaller than the map size to prevent errors.
- **Note about bounding box**: UAV will only explore the space defined by the bouding box. It is recommended that the map size is set much larger than the bounding box, as setting the map size close to bounding box often results in

These parameters are located in `FUEL/fuel_planner/exploration_manager/launch/exploration.launch`.

### Camera Calibration

- **Camera Parameters**: Tune `Cx`, `Cy`, `Fx`, and `Fy` according to the X_500 depth camera specifications used in your Gazebo simulation to achieve accurate depth perception.

Camera calibration settings can also be found in `FUEL/fuel_planner/exploration_manager/launch/exploration.launch`.

### Motion Control

- **Velocity and Acceleration**: Set `max_vel` and `max_acc` to 0.4 for steady and controlled UAV movement.

The motion control parameters are located in `FUEL/fuel_planner/exploration_manager/launch/exploration.launch`.

### Image Processing

- **Depth Scaling Factor**: Use a `k_depth_scaling_factor` of 3431.15 in `Algorithm.xml` to scale pixel values accurately. Alternatively, a value of 1000.0 can be used.

The `Algorithm.xml` file is located in `FUEL/fuel_planner/exploration_manager/launch`.

### Yaw Control

- **Yaw Acceleration (ydd_)**: Limit the yaw acceleration to avoid sudden changes.
- **Optimization Weights (w_dir_)**: Increase this value to reduce sharp yaw changes.
- **Relaxation Time**: Use a higher `relax_time` to achieve smoother yaw transitions.
- **Position Trajectory Duration (yd_)**: Adjust to set the minimum duration for position trajectories.

## Recommended Settings

The following values have been determined to provide the best results for our simulation:

- **exploration/yd**: 50
- **exploration/ydd**: 55
- **exploration/w_dir**: 2.5
- **exploration/relax_time**: 2.0

These settings help minimize abrupt yaw changes while maintaining efficient exploration times. Be cautious not to reduce yaw rates excessively, as this may lead to FUEL exploration failures.

### PID Velocity Controllers 
PID controllers are used to maintain precise control over the UAV's velocity in various directions. The parameters for these controllers are as follows: 
- **PID for X-axis (self.pid_x = PID(2.0, 0.1, 0.0))**
- **PID for Y-axis (self.pid_y = PID(0.8, 0.1, 0.0))**
- **PID for Z-axis (self.pid_z = PID(0.8, 0.1, 0.0))**
- **PID for Yaw (self.pid_yaw = PID(2.0, 0.1, 0.0))**

#### Tuning Guidelines 
- **Proportional (P)**: This term responds to the current error. Increasing the P value typically results in a faster response but can cause overshoot or oscillations if set too high. 
- **Integral (I)**: This term responds to accumulated errors over time. It helps eliminate steady-state errors. If the I value is too high, it can cause the system to be slow or oscillate. 
- **Derivative (D)**: This term responds to the rate of change of the error, providing a damping effect. It can help stabilize the system but may lead to instability if set too high. 

Carefully tuning these parameters will help achieve smooth and accurate UAV operation in your Gazebo simulations. Adjust settings as needed to fit specific simulation requirements or environments.


## Issues

### FUEL unable to find any frontiers

If FUEL package fails with error "No coverable frontiers" when triggered, then modify parameters in file fuel_planner/exploration_manager/launch/exploration.launch. Box_min_x, box_min_y, Box_min_z, Box_max_x, Box_max_y, Box_max_z values need to be changed.
